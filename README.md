# Ordinal Bond 
Welcome to the Ordinal Bond project. The purpose of this project is to create Bitcoin Bonds on Zeta chain that enable a more dynamic mode of DeFi with "hidden" value transfers. 
The modern financial system was founded on the principle and practice of bonds. These are what made it possible to for the first forms of decentralized finance in the form of cross border and international transactions where you had bankers in Venice issuing bearer bonds against assets, 
and said bonds being used for commerce around the world. The Zetachain cross chain blockchain ecosystem is little different from this early financial frontier. The ordinal bond project aims to make it easy to transfer significant amounts of capital across DeFi networks at a reduced footprint. 
To illustrate the way cryptocurrency transfers happen today is the same as how banks used to move cash with security trucks i.e. loud and attention grabbing. With Ordinal Bonds new and exciting trades and commercial exchanges can take place represented as simple NFT transfers
whilst the Value Locked remains stationary and yield bearing on the home chain.
